## The Project

### What is ConnectMe?

ConnectMe is a web application designed to help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of team-based communications. Our goal is to produce something flexible enough to be used in multiple settings where leaders (or others responsible for coordinating groups) may benefit from having the kind of tools our project will provide. The emphasis, however, will be on professional settings.

One of the tools in question will be structured post-meeting surveys, designed to determine whether all meeting attendees are on the same page. This can help meeting organizers decide whether additional discussion needs to happen, or whether subsequent meetings would be a waste of time and resources.

Additionally, the application will feature at least one or two simple icebreaker minigames, to help orient newcomers to the organization or facilitate interaction between those who have never worked together before.

### Why did we choose this idea?

Originally we intended to focus only on the icebreaker aspect of the application. As we started to discuss the details of our project, however, we decided to shift focus to a more general usage (with the icebreakers being a side feature rather than a focal point).

Inspiration for the post-meeting survey idea actually came from our own experiences of trying to work as a team. We found that oftentimes, we would conclude a meeting thinking we were all on the same page, only to find out that many of us had slightly different takeaways from what was discussed. A simple tool such as this could have helped us to see any miscommunications so we could act on them and pin down our collective vision much earlier.  

### What challenges have we encountered along the way?

As described above, there were times where we thought we were in alignment as a team before finding out that we were not. That was our primary communications challenge, though effectively using the collaboration tools at our disposal (Jira, GitHub, Discord, etc.) has also been a learning curve.  

#### AWS and Hosting

One of the first technical challenges we ran into was hosting. Originally we had planned to use AWS, and Nathan spent quite a bit of time researching options to determine what the right route for us would be. After consulting Prof. Gillian Maurer and Prof. Kristofferson Culmer, we found that AWS was not a recommended route for us to take with hosting. It was suggested we use NameCheap instead, so we quickly changed course to start setting up shared hosting and purchasing a domain through there.

#### Unity and Game Development

As we refocused the emphasis of ConnectMe away from the icebreaker minigames and towards a more general purpose of "communication productivity tools", the need to spend a lot of development time and energy on the games has lessened. Given advice we received from Prof. Michael Tompkins, we intend to look at existing icebreaker exercises already in use and find ways to digitalize one or two of them for our project.

Since these minigames will be much simpler than we anticipated at the outset, we believe using Unity would likely be overkill and would introduce a lot of unnecessary complexity when we could focus that time on other aspects of the project. Concern about WebGL and how we would integrate the minigames into the web app was a concern as well.

With the newly anticipated simplicity of any minigames we create for ConnectMe, we think JavaScript (and perhaps PHP if necessary to connect any back-end) should be enough to accomplish our goals. Using JavaScript has the added benefit of ensuring compatibility across virtually any web browser.
